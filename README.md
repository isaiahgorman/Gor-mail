# Gor-mail

46 emails.csv contains 46 fake emails.
500 emailss.csv contains 500 fake emails.
data_culler.py contains pandas libraries that are used to cull the data(the fake emails but you will have to mainually change the path to the files but once done it will cull the data into the 3 categories that we care about for this project. It will then update the cleaned_emails.csv file by appending the culled data to it.)
send.py is a demostrative file of the email sender. it is small scale and can only send emails to me personal email.
saved_emails.txt is the list of saved emails from Gor-mail.py
Gor-mail.py searches messages from culled emails for a specific word you input and then stores those emails and messages for interaction later. If I ever fully complete the project it can be used to access your own personal email and will serve as an augmented version of the search on gmail as well be used to send emails.
